Adding New Content Step-by-Step

    Create Book File in client/src/lib/bible-content/[bookname].ts
        Use lowercase for filename (e.g., romans.ts, psalms.ts)
        Follow the format above

    Book Properties:
        id: Use standard Bible book numbering (Genesis=1, Exodus=2, etc.; Matthew=40, Mark=41, etc.)
        shortName: Lower case 3-4 letter abbreviation (e.g., "gen", "exo", "rom")
        testament: "old" or "new"
        chapterCount: Total number of chapters in the book

    Chapter Structure:
        Each chapter needs an id and chapter (both the same number)
        Each chapter needs a descriptive title that summarizes the main content
        Chapters are divided into sections with headings and verses

    Section Divisions:
        Create logical sections with descriptive titles based on narrative or thematic shifts
        Old Testament narrative usually divides by storylines
        Epistles often divide by logical arguments or topics
        Poetic books divide by changes in themes or speakers

    Verse Formatting:
        Begin a new verse with a number and full text
        Format with proper quotes (use escaped quotes \" for dialogue)
        Preserve paragraph breaks from the source text where appropriate

    After Adding Content:
        Add the import to client/src/lib/bibleContentLoader.ts
        Restart the workflow to clear any cache
        Test by navigating to the new book/chapter

Testing New Content

    After adding a new book or chapters, always:
        Check navigation in the sidebar works
        Ensure all chapters load correctly
        Verify section headings display properly
        Test verse display and formatting
        Clear cache files if needed: rm -rf content/verses/[book-id]-[chapter]

Handling Errors

If you encounter errors with content loading:

    Check the browser console for errors
    Verify syntax in your book file (missing commas, brackets, etc.)
    Clear the cache files in the content/verses/ directory
    Restart the workflow

Next Steps
Priority Tasks

    Complete the Old Testament books, starting with:
        Exodus through Deuteronomy
        Historical books (Joshua, Judges, etc.)
    Complete the New Testament, focusing on:
        Romans and other Pauline epistles
        Remaining gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke)

Content Guidelines

    Ensure consistent section divisions across similar book types
    Old Testament narrative: 5-10 verses per section typically
    Epistles: Divide by argument/topic (usually 3-10 verses)
    Maintain consistent styling for quotations, especially in dialogue-heavy sections

Known Issues

    Some TypeScript errors in admin components (can be addressed later)
    Server-side caching might need optimization for larger books
    Mobile view still needs testing with more complex books

Final Notes

The Bible content system is designed to be modular and extensible. The patterns established with John can be applied to all books. Remember that the caching system will help with performance once content is initially loaded, so focus on proper structure and accuracy rather than performance concerns.
